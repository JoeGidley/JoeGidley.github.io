    I own the highest quality sound kit from manufacturers Sound Devices, Lectrosonics, Sennheiser, DPA, Tentacle Sync and Ambient. Kit packages are fully negotiable and customisable. I am able to hire in and use all sorts of extra sound equipment to cover the needs of your production and relish unusual or challenging audio requirements. I have lots of experience working on high-end productions as a sound assistant so Iâ€™ve learnt a lot from some of the best sound mixers in the UK. <br> I have my own UK wide PMSE radio licence, public liability insurance, kit insurance, DBS certificate and full driving licence. <br>I live in Bristol but am used to working in London, Cardiff and further afield.
