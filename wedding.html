            <h3>The Day</h3>

            <h4>The wedding will be at Three Pools – a permaculture farm near Abergavenny. If the weather allows, the
                plan is for most of the day to be outside, including ceremony and dinner. The ceremony will begin at 2
                o’clock so please arrive in time to take your seat beforehand. We hope that it will be seasonably warm
                but it would be wise to bring some layers just in case!

                <h4>There is plenty of parking on site.</h4>

        <h3>Staying</h3>


        <h4>There is a campsite at Three Pools, which guests are more than welcome to use for free. It’s quite rustic
            but there is running water as well as loos and a shower block. Tents and camper vans are both welcome. If
            glamping is more your thing then there are also bell tents available to hire from the Three Pools website.
            They sleep up to four people and are furnished with single beds (inc. bedding). The price is £160 and is the
            same however many people you have. Follow this link to book: https://www.threepools.co.uk/upcoming-events
        </h4>

        <h4>Breakfast will be provided for the campers on Sunday morning as well as the use of a wood-fired sauna. You
            can follow your sauna with a dip in one of the pools! </h4>

        <h4>There are also plenty of rental properties around if you prefer not to stay under canvas. Abergavenny is
            just an 11-minute drive away from Three Pools and has hotels/guesthouses and a Premier Inn.</h4>
